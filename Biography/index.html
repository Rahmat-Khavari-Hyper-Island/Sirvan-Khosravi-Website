          <p>
            Sirvan Khosravi is a prominent Pop/Rock Singer/Producer/Keyboardist
            based in Iran, best known for his sophisticated productions and the
            fresh sound he introduced to Iran’s music scene, breaking off from
            the traditional atmosphere which had previously dominated the
            industry.

            He started his career in music by producing, mixing and mastering
            songs for other artists, working behind the scenes and quickly
            building a reputation as one of the best producers and engineers in
            Iran all the while working on his own music, developing his sound
            and working on records that would go on to become big hits. Some of
            his hits include “Tanha Nazar”, “Doost Daram Zendegiro (I Love
            Life)", “Khaterate to (Memories of You)”, “Soojehat Tekrarie” and
            “Ghabe Akse Khali”, which immediately became sensations among the
            young audience in Iran.

            friend and inspiration) who is a well-known and highly respected
            guitarist, singer and songwriter, and Sirvan’s brother Xaniar
            Khosravi, who is also a popular singer/songwriter and works both as
            a solo artist and as a member of the band “Ehaam”.
